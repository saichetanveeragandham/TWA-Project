This file is used to configure GitHub Actions workflows. A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool offered by GitHub is called GitHub Actions. It enables direct software process automation in your GitHub repository.

Here is how the configuration file is broken down:

Events that cause a push or pull request to the main or issue_6 branches set off the workflow. This indicates that the workflow will execute each time code is posted to these branches or a pull request is submitted against them.

Jobs: There is only one job in the process, which is called test. Virtual machines are used to run jobs. Depending on their dependencies, they can operate concurrently, in parallel, or sequentially.

Runs-on: The most recent Ubuntu version is used to execute the test job. GitHub offers runners for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.

The test job comprises a number of steps. The same runner is used to execute each phase of a job, enabling them to exchange data. Steps can execute commands, setup tasks, actions in your repository, actions available in a public repository, and actions made available in a Docker registry.

Check out code: In this phase, the code from your repository is checked out onto the runner using the actions/checkout@v2 action.

The current directory is changed to "remote" in this phase. If the next steps must be performed in that directory, then this might be required.

Install Node.js: The actions/setup-node@v2 action is used in this stage to install Node.js 14.x on the runner.

Install dependencies: To install the dependencies for your project, first change the directory to #filelocation (you should replace this with the actual path). Next, execute yarn install.

Run tests: In this step, the directory is also changed to #filelocation (again, replace this with the correct path), and yarn test is then run to run the tests for your project.

This process serves as a simple illustration of a CI pipeline for a Node.js project. It guarantees that the project's dependencies are installed and tests are executed for each push or pull request. This keeps the codebase's quality high and makes it easier to find and remedy any issues.
