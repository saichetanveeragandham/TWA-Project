Above is the initial approach to this project.
* On the first go, we will ask job seejers and employers to fill out the google forms.
* We will thenextract the information in .CSV format and then load it to database.
* On the next step, we create framework that access the database data.
  * Framework includes:
    * connection to the database
    * loading data.
    * retrieving data.
    * mapping job seekers to the appropriate job positions
* This mapped data will be available on the front end either by sorting based on employer details or with the job positions.
